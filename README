This plugin overrides tiddlyweb.web.util:server_host_url to pay
attention to the HTTP_HOST variable if it is present and use it for
creating outgoing urls. By default the url provided by the server_host
settings in config is used.

This allows one TiddlyWeb server to support multiple hosts in a
named virtual host kind of way.
